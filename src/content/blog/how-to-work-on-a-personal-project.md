If you read the title of this post and are saying to yourself, _I already know
how to work on personal projects, I've been doing it for years_, then this post
isn't for you. This is for people who haven't worked on their first project, or
who are stuck in tutorial hell.

## 1. Find something to work on, and find a reason to work on it

At the beginning, this is the hardest part. If you have hobbies outside of
programming: gaming, music, sports, etc..., then you can try making a project
relating to those.

- learn how to host a minecraft or csgo server
- write a music visualizer
- make a sports game predictor
