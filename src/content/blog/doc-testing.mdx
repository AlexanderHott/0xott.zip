As pointed out by [CodeAesthetic](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeAesthetic) in his
amazing video titled
["Don't Write Comments"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bf7vDBBOBUA) (really,
go watch it.)

> Comments get bugs like code. When people make changes to code, they often
> don't update the comments to match.

e.g.

```py
# Verifies the password is at least 8 characters long
if len(password) < 10:
    return False
```

He is 100% correct, but then goes on to say

> But unlike comments, we have tools to stop bugs from entering code. We have
> tests, compiler checks and linting. We don't have any system like that for
> comments.

[As ThePrimeagen (ThePrimeagen mentioned) points out in an _obviously pre-watched_ reaction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5DJxz6_xMA&t=432s),
there is definately going to be an AI startup that will check/generate the
correctness of comments.

<div class="bg-neutral-900 p-4 rounded-lg">

<div class="text-center text-2xl font-bold">
  <span class="bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-400 to-pink-600 bg-clip-text text-transparent">
    //
  </span>
  Commentlyly
</div>

"AI-powered documentation for code simple enough to be understood by AI"

<div class="justify-self-center text-xl">Before</div>

```java
public void setUp() {
}
```

<div class="justify-self-center text-xl">✨ After ✨</div>

```java
/**
* Sets the up.
*/
public void setUp() {
}
```

  <div class="flex justify-center">
  <a
    target="_blank"
    href="http://127.0.0.1:3000/sign-up"
  >
    <button class="cursor-pointer rounded-md bg-black px-4 py-2 text-center text-xl font-bold text-white no-underline">{"Get started with "}
      <span class="bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-400 to-pink-600 bg-clip-text text-transparent">Commentlyly AI</span>
      {" for free"}
    </button>
    </a>
  </div>
</div>

The greatest part, is that once your code has comments on everything, you'll
need AI to keep them up to date.

Maybe when Apple releases the
[iLLM, AI will finally be smart.](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2024/01/02/the-i-in-llm-stands-for-intelligence/)

But I'm not here to talk about AI today.

CodeAesthetic goes on to claim

Which is interesting, because

## Documentation suffers from the same issues that comments do

Let's walk through an example.

```py
def verify_password(password: str) -> bool:
    return (
      len(password) >= 8 and
      any(char.isupper() for char in password)
    )
```

Well this is a pretty complex function, we should add some documentation on how
to use it.

```py
def verify_password(password: str) -> bool:
    """Verifies that `password` is valid."""
    return (
      len(password) >= 8 and
      any(char.isupper() for char in password)
    )
```

Well duh, it's literally called `verify_password`.

```py
def verify_password(password: str) -> bool:
    """
    Verifies that `password` is valid.

    `password` is valid if
    - it is at least 8 characters long.
    - it has at least one uppercase letter.
    """
    return (
      len(password) >= 8 and
      any(char.isupper() for char in password)
    )
```

Computers are advancing, 8 characters is no longer enough.

```py
def verify_password(password: str) -> bool:
    """
    Verifies that `password` is valid.

    `password` is valid if
    - it is at least 8 characters long.
    - it has at least one uppercase letter.
    """
    return (
      len(password) >= 20 and
      any(char.isupper() for char in password)
    )
```

Phew, that was a close one, we almost got hacked.

Now the frontend team goes to implement the sign-in page and sees the following
documentation when they hover over the function.

<div class="bg-neutral-900 p-4">
  ```python
  (function) def verify_password(password: str) -> bool
  ```

Verifies that `password` is valid.

`password` is valid if

- it is at least 8 characters long.
- it has at least one uppercase letter.

</div>

The first line in the docstring is correct, but the implementation details are
incorrect.

Keeping specific details in the docstring is a bad idea. Instead, we can show a
few examples of how the function works, and if the implementation details are so
important, **just read the code**.

````python
def verify_password(password: str) -> bool:
    """
    Verifies that `password` is valid.

    ```python
    >>> verify_password("password")
    False

    >>> verify_password("Password123")
    False

    >>> verify_password("Tr0ub4dor&3")
    False

    >>> verify_password("correct horse battery staple")
    False

    >>> verify_password("correct Horse battery staple")
    True

    \```
    """
    return (
      len(password) >= 20 and
      any(char.isupper() for char in password)
    )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()
````

```bash
python3 -m doctest -v verify_password.py
```

It may seem weird at first that comments have an effect on the code, you may be
having flashbacks to
[Tom](https://thedailywtf.com/articles/the-inner-json-effect), but this is very
similar to [table](https://go.dev/wiki/TableDrivenTests)
[tests](https://dave.cheney.net/2019/05/07/prefer-table-driven-tests) and
preserves [locality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMTFzpxR0QQ)
[of](https://grugbrain.dev/#grug-on-soc)
[behavior](https://htmx.org/essays/locality-of-behaviour/).

Inevitably, when 20 character is too short and someone goes to update it to 32,
the doctests will fail, forcing them to update the docs, and hopefully
reconsider the entire docstring, fixing any differences between the words and
the code.

## Python `doctest` snippet

```python
# test_docstrings.py
import importlib
import pkgutil
import types
import typing as t
import doctest

import my_module


def test_docstrings():
    def iter_modules(package: types.ModuleType) -> t.Generator[types.ModuleType]:
        if not hasattr(package, "__path__"):
            return
        for _, name, ispkg in pkgutil.walk_packages(package.__path__, package.__name__ + "."):
            try:
                module = importlib.import_module(name)
                yield module
                if ispkg:
                    yield from iter_modules(module)
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Skipping {name} due to import error: {e}")

    verbose = True

    res = doctest.testmod(my_module, verbose=verbose)
    assert res.failed == 0

    for module in iter_modules(my_module):
        res = doctest.testmod(module, verbose=verbose)
        assert res.failed == 0
```
